# Bike-sharing-challenge
A neural LSTM model for predicting the net ratio.


Implementation includes three files: 
1. predict.ipynb: the implementation of the neural LSTM model.
2. predict_baseline.ipynb: the implementation of the baseline model (only using neural networks)
3. visualize.ipynb: data visualization


Requirement:
1. Keras
2. Tensorflow
3. Sklearn
